# Sublime Completions

Useful Sublime Text completions I use personally.

They are to put in your Packages/User folder.

## One-liner installation

Set the current directory to the git repository. Then, execute one of the following commands depending on your platform:

### Windows

In `cmd.exe`:

```bat
copy *.sublime-completions "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\User\"
```

Note: if you had installed Sublime Text 3 before upgrading to Sublime Text 4, the path may be different for you (`\Sublime Text 3\` instead of `\Sublime Text\`).

### Linux

In `sh`:

```sh
cp *.sublime-completions ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/User/
```

Note: if you had installed Sublime Text 3 before upgrading to Sublime Text 4, the path may be different for you (`/sublime-text-3/` instead of `/sublime-text/`).
